<h2>My top 3 Favourite Movies Of All Times</h2>
<hr>

<h3>I. 10 Things I Hate About You</h3>
<p>This is a  great movie with my favourite favourite trope - "ENEMIES TO LOVERS". <br>
 Kat and Patrick are literal couple goals with Kat's witty replies and swoon-worthy looks of Patrick.</p>

 <h3>II. Barbie</h3>
 <p>Turning our favourite childhood memories with barbie to a full fledged production for women empowerment and 
    gender equality in our society, this movie deserves tremendous appreciation. Margot Robbie was awesome in the movie.
    And Greta Gerwig directions are one to lust over every time. </p>

<h3>III. Safe Haven</h3>
<p>There are very few mystery, thriller movies I like and this takes the number one spot. <br>
     It has everything one could ask for in a movie and more.</p>
