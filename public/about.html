<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Anoushka. I’m a B.Tech student in Computers and Communication Engineering, but when I’m not knee-deep in code, I’m probably figuring out how to turn ordinary problems into opportunities for creativity. Whether it's AI, networking, or web development, I like to dive in and come up with solutions that not only work but feel like a fresh twist on the expected.</p>

<p>With a knack for tackling tech challenges head-on, I love the thrill of crafting new approaches to well-worn problems. You could say I’m the kind of developer who enjoys blending innovation with practical problem-solving, always striving to create something more efficient, intuitive, or just plain cool. My style? Think creative, yet calculated — always hunting for that "aha!" moment.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you can find me indulging in books(a lot of them!), watching movies and probably finding out about new apps. Whether it’s gaming, hiking, or binge-watching a good series, I believe a healthy mix of work and play fuels the best ideas. Let's build something awesome together!</p>
